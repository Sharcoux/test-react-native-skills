# Welcome !

So, basically, here are the 2 tasks:

## 1. Create a Container that can adapt its font-size to make its children fit its parent

So imagine, you have a container of (200x20) pixels, and you have a TextInput for instance, and someone is typing a very long sentence. We would like the font size to reduce while the text is being typed. This should work both when the content is overflowing horizontally and vertically.

## 2. Create a Table layout in React Native that could receive a bunch of TextInput and reshape gracefully when the user is typing things in.

**Important**: You have to imagine that the TextInput could be multiline.

So here, you need to measure the components both horizontally and vertically to make table display correctly.

I would appreciate that the solution would be as optimized as possible.

Ideally, you would wrap your table in the container developed previously and this should demonstrate that the test succeeded.


If you have any question, feel free to ask.

Good luck ! ;)
